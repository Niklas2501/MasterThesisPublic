# STGCNs for Predictive Maintenance
Source code repository accompanying my master thesis, which focuses on the application of Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (STGCNs) for predictive maintenance.

The dataset used as well as the trained models can be downloaded [here](https://seafile.rlp.net/d/e2ef70c8da834c06bf27/?p=%2F).
